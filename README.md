Compartmental models aims to model the evolution of infectious diseases separating the population in compartments, sections of the population with certain characteristics.
SIR is the simplest compartmental model that asigns the population in three categories: S(Susceptibles), I(Infectious) and R(Recovered). This proyects tries to determine
the R-0 parameter for some countries whose infectious evolution fits the SIR model.
