# Covid-19 R-0 parameter estimation using the SIR model

Compartmental models aim to model the evolution of infectious diseases by 
separating the population into compartments, sections of the population with 
certain characteristics. SIR is the simplest compartmental model that separates 
the population into three categories: S (Susceptible), I (Infectious) and R (Recovered). 
This project tries to determine the R-0 parameter for some countries whose infectious evolution fits best to the SIR model.

# Requirements

pandas, numpy and scipy

# Usage

```python
python SIR_model.py
```
Options:
```python
usage: Visualize your data statistics comparing multiple configurations
       [-h] [-c COUNTRY] [-s SUSCEPTIBLES] [-i INFECTED] [-r RECOVERED]
       [-a A_ESTIMATE] [-b B_ESTIMATE] [--days DAYS]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c COUNTRY, --country COUNTRY
                        Country to analize
  -s SUSCEPTIBLES, --susceptibles SUSCEPTIBLES
                        Number of susceptible people to get infected. Depends
                        on each country's population size
  -i INFECTED, --infected INFECTED
                        Number of infected of day 1
  -r RECOVERED, --recovered RECOVERED
                        Number of recovered people on day 1 (defaults to 0)
  -a A_ESTIMATE, --a_estimate A_ESTIMATE
                        "a" parameter first estimation
  -b B_ESTIMATE, --b_estimate B_ESTIMATE
                        'b' parameter first estimation
  --days DAYS           Number of days to see the infected evolution
```
# How to Use 

Model can be tested for Italy, Spain, Germany, India, Netherlands and United Kingdom. 
The first step is to determine the estimation parameters 'a' and 'b' and the initial 
susceptible population (S), these can be established randomly but the model may not 
converge or remain at some local minimum when trying to find the optimal parameters 'a' and 'b'. 
One option is to use the SIR_model.nb notebook and manipulate the graph on it until 
the proper initial parameters can be tested.
R-0 is the basic reproduction number, is the expected number of cases generated by one individual
and it's defined as R-0 = a*N/b where N is the total sample population.

# Some results

Italy: N = 15000, a = 1.6264e-05, b = 0.0630, R-0 = 3.8725
Spain: N = 20000, a = 1.2789e-05, b = 0.0733, R-0 = 3.4895
